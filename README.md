# Keeper-app
This is a fully-functional to-do list application, written using React.
Hooks, props, states, and javaScript array functions like filter and map were used in the code to improve functionality.
Notes can be added and deleted easily. For every new note a new sticky note is appeared on the screen and by clicking on the delete icon it is disappeared.
Some simple interactivity is added to the app for the sake of better user experience(text area enlarges by the first click, the button changes color while hovering etc.)
